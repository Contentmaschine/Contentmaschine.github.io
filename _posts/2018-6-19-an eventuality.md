Our world - a place to preserve, isn´t it? But what if there were a way to destroy it?

something of that sort was out there. that much <b>CLONK</b> Quiet! Sorry, forget that, anyhow, that much I knew. And I knew that it was my duty to get involved. That was me:

Those innocent eyes. They had seen nothing yet. 
<br>
<br>
I was devoted and I had a vision. An abstract idea of what was needed to save us all. Problem was that I didn´t quite know yet what we were up against, but I tried nevertheless. I held speeches, urged people to listen to the winds of change, to get the same insight into time and reality as I had. I wanted them so see the inevitability of the upcoming. But without a common enemy I never stood a chance. I tried to rally them all but they wouldn´t listen, too fed up with their own lives, worlds even. No one followed me. Except one.

A visionary and a technical mastermind, let´s call him The Engineer. He was the first to see the truth in my words and he swore unyielding loyalty to our cause. He was the only person in the world I would have died for. Still is, although... things have changed. I loved him once, but something broke when <b style="font-size:1.5em">CLONK</b> Knock it off! Ahm, where was I... Together we strived to be humanitys saviour, which in a sense we were. We brought a new age,
<br>
<br>
I´m getting ahead of myself.
<br>
<br>
Now we developed a plan, a plan to catch the publics eye - we had to become idols, icons of science and success, to let our warnings be heard. To get to the people who we really needed to convince. And so we worked day and night, not caring for what we did, just with demand in mind. Never stopping to innovate, The Engineer could make my every ideas possible. Soon we were considered the spearhead of technological advancement, with The Engineers technical prowess and my marketing skills we actually did it. We managed to exploit every aspect of modern society to get to speak to the people we so desperatly needed to convince. That something was coming and that it quite possibly could end humankind.
<br>
<br>
And like The Engineer before, they listened and saw the truth in my words. They finally gave us the ressources to assemble a team of the brightest and most promising technicians and scientists we could find. With the publics support and the elites standing behind us as well, we could at last begin our real mission.
<br>
<br>
We spent endless hours debating with some of the greatest minds of the planet, but it was too big a task. And then it hit us, that was the point. We wouldn´t be able to solve this on our own, we needed to create a tool that could search with us. An artifical intelligence, whose intellect would surpass our own, to help us broaden our understanding of the universe, to uncover the answers that were hidden from us.
<br>
<br>
This was the right way forward, we all felt it. Under the supervision of The Engineer we started to make sketches and build prototypes, which looked astonishingly promising. We soon noticed that we were making progress at an eery pace, but we took it as prove for our theory and worked even harder. Our whole team put its heart and soul into development and we all knew that we were making history in these long, but beautiful <b>CLONK</b> WILL YOU STOP IT?!

We completed it. After many, many years we had finally done it. We wouldn´t need to worry about things to come anymore. Our invention had passed every single test glamourously and although it was still restrained, bound to the limits we gave it as a security measure, we knew of its potential and we were awestruck. It would find out what we couldn´t.

The following night we celebrated.
