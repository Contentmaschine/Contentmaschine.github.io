our world - a place to preserve, isn´t it? But what if there were a way to destroy it?

something of that sort was out there. that much we knew, well, CLONK Quiet! Sorry, forget that, anyhow, that much I knew. And I knew that it was my duty to get involved. That was me:

Those innocent eyes. They had seen nothing yet.

I was devoted and I had a vision. An abstract idea of what was needed to save us all. Problem was that I didn´t quite know yet what we were up against, but I tried nevertheless. I held speeches, urged people to listen to the winds of change, to get the same insight into time and reality as I had. I wanted them so see the inevitability of the upcoming. But without a common enemy I never stood a chance. I tried to rally them all but they wouldn´t listen, too fed up with their own lives, worlds even. No one followed me. Except one.

A visionary and a technical mastermind, let´s call him The Engineer. He was the first to see the truth in my words and he swore unyielding loyalty to our cause. He was the only person in the world I would have died for. Still is, although... things have changed. I loved him once, but something broke when CLONK Knock it off! Ahm, where was I... Together we strived to be humanitys saviour, which in a sense we were. We brought a new age, just our place in it was unclear.

I´m getting ahead of myself.

Now we developed a plan, a plan to catch the publics eye - we had to become idols, icons of science and success, to let our warnings be heard. To get to the people who we really needed to convince. And so we worked day and night, not caring for what we did, just with demand in mind. Never stopping to innovate, The Engineer could make my every ideas possible. Soon we were considered the spearhead of technological advancement, with The Engineers technical prowess and my marketing skills we actually did it. We managed to exploit every aspect of modern society to get to speak to the people we so desperatly needed to convince. That something was coming and that it quite possibly could end humankind.
