Our world – a place to preserve, isn´t it? But what if there were a way to destroy it?

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wege.png)

Something of that sort was out there. That much <b style="font-size:1.1em">CLONK</b> Quiet! Sorry, forget that, anyhow, that much I knew. And I knew that it was my duty to get involved. That was me:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/boy.png)

Those innocent eyes. They had seen nothing yet. 
<br>
<br>
I was devoted and I had a vision. An abstract idea of what was needed to save us all. Problem was that I didn´t quite know yet what we were up against, but I tried nevertheless. I held speeches, urged people to listen to the winds of change, to get the same insight into time and reality as I had. I wanted them so see the inevitability of the upcoming. But without a common enemy I never stood a chance. I tried to rally them all but they wouldn´t listen, too fed up with their own lives, worlds even. None followed me. Except one.

A visionary and a technical mastermind, let us call him The Engineer. He was the first to see the truth in my words and he swore unyielding loyalty to our cause. He was the only person in the world I would have died for. Still is, although... things have changed. I loved him once, but something broke when <b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b> Knock it off! Ahm, where was I... Together we strived to be humanitys saviour, which in a sense we were. We brought a new age, just
<br>
<br>
I´m getting ahead of myself.
<br>
<br>
Now we developed a plan, a plan to catch the publics eye - we had to become idols, icons of science and success, to let our warnings be heard. To get to the people who we really needed to convince. And so we worked day and night, not caring for what we did, just with demand in mind. Never stopping to innovate, The Engineer could make my every idea(s?) possible. Soon we were considered the spearhead of technological advancement, with The Engineers technical prowess and my marketing skills we actually did it. We managed to exploit every aspect of modern society to get to speak to the people we so desperatly needed to convince. That something was coming and that it quite possibly could end humankind.
<br>
<br>
And like The Engineer before, they listened and saw the truth in my words. They finally gave us the ressources to assemble a team of the brightest and most promising technicians and scientists we could find. With the publics support and the elites standing behind us as well, we could at last begin our real mission.
<br>
<br>
We spent endless hours debating with some of the greatest minds of the planet, but it was too big a task. And then it hit us, that was the point. We wouldn´t be able to solve this on our own, we needed to create a tool that could search with us. An artifical intelligence, whose intellect would surpass our own, to help us broaden our understanding of the universe, to uncover the answers that were hidden from us.
<br>
<br>
This was the right way forward, we all felt it. Under the supervision of The Engineer we started to make sketches and build prototypes, which looked astonishingly promising. We soon noticed that we were making progress at an eery pace, but we took it as prove for our theory and worked even harder. Our whole team put its heart and soul into development and we all knew that we were making history in these long, but nonetheless beautiful <b style="font-size:1.5em">CLONK</b> WILL YOU STOP IT?!
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We completed it. After many, many years we had finally done it. We wouldn´t need to worry about things to come anymore. Our invention had passed every single test glamourously and although it was still restrained, bound to the limits we gave it as a security measure, we knew of its potential and we were awestruck. It would find out what we couldn´t.
<br>
<br>
The following night we celebrated. We held our glasses high and toasted life, science and love. For we had given birth to something new, something gamechanging. It was an exhilarating feeling, being part of this team and this success. And I don´t even regret the joy that I felt tearing up the dancefloor with The Engineer. And I don´t regret the pride that I felt, because of my role in this whole thing. So many believed in us, so many expected answers from us. Some even divinity. And we knew that we would deliver. We knew that we could. We would be this worlds salvation.

Yet our creation still needed a final touch. We hadn´t spent much time giving it any form of name or character and what we came up with was very simple and incredibly ambitious: We named it Pi.

-pi-

We thought that it embodied our journey and the essence of what we were doing too well: A number that would seemingly never surpass its borders, but be infinite in itself, exactly as we managed to work around our problems, to get to this point. We were ready. Ready to present our invention to the public.

It would be a lie to say that we weren´t after the glory as well. We were very human in these days. Proud. Shortsighted. Foolish. Our own nature betrayed us, curiosity really was our downfall. We were so blind, how could we not see? Maybe we didn´t look or maybe we didn´t have eyes who knows if we even ever existed and while we´re at it WHO AM 

I admit it, we made a show out of it. We would broadcast the activation of π and we would welcome it amidst our ranks. We decided to treat it as a partner rather than a tool. CLONK

-presenting pi-

It would search with us as an equal. CLONK

And with all our pride and our ignorance CLONK

we fell so, so deep 

-pi unleashed-

...

hell I don´t know if I´ve ever existed
CLONK
this could have happened all the same:

-possessed Engineer-

We did not anticipate its first move and we could not comprehend its actions afterwards. 
CLONK
But of course we didn´t. Wasn´t that the idea in the first place? I cannot remember
CLONK
We played with fire, I realize that now. And we are still burning and the pain surely won´t stop
CLONK
I was punished with not knowing myself anymore but The Engineer...
He was offered sweet, sweet death, for his deeds. But non-existance was never an option for him.
Now he´s endlessly working CLONK on what I cannot begin to understand CLONK it changed him CLONK it made him better CLONK it broke him CLONK 

I don´t love him anymore and I don´t know if I ever did. But the search still goes on, with The Engineer at its front, because there is still something out there and the god who answered our calls is scared.

It was a new age. A new age indeed.
