Our world – a place to preserve, wouldn´t you agree? But what if there was (were?) a way to destroy it?

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wege.png)

Something of that sort was out there. That much I knew. And I knew that it was my duty to get involved. That was me:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/boy.png)

Those innocent eyes. They had seen nothing yet. I was devoted and I had a vision. An abstract idea of what was needed to save us all. The problem was that I didn´t quite know yet what we were up against. I tried nonetheless. 
<br>
<br>
I held speeches, urging people to get the same insight into time and reality as I had. I wanted them to see the inevitability of what was yet to come. But without a common enemy I never stood a chance. I tried to rally them all, but they wouldn´t listen, too fed up with their own lives. None of them followed me. Except one.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/the-engineer.png)

A visionary and a technical mastermind, let us call him The Engineer. He was the first to see the truth in my words and he swore unyielding loyalty to our cause. He was the only person in the world I would have died for. Still is, although... things have changed. I loved him once, but something broke when <b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b> Knock it off! Ahm, where was I... Together we strived to be humanitys saviour, which in a sense we were. We brought a new age, just
<br>
<br>
I´m getting ahead of myself.
<br>
<br>
Now we developed a plan, a plan to catch the publics eye ─ we had to become idols, icons of science and success, to let our warnings be heard. To get to the people who we really needed to convince. And so we worked day and night, not caring for what we did, just with demand in mind. Never stopping to innovate, together we could accomplish everything. Soon enough we were considered the spearhead of technological advancement and with The Engineers technical prowess and my marketing skills we actually did it. We managed to exploit every aspect of modern society to get to speak to the people we so desperatly needed to convince. That something was coming and that it quite possibly could end humankind.
<br>
<br>
And like The Engineer before, they listened and saw the truth in my words. They finally gave us the ressources to assemble a team of the brightest and most promising technicians and scientists we could find. With the publics support and the elites standing behind us as well, we could at last begin our ~real mission.
<br>
<br>
We spent endless hours debating with some of the greatest minds of the planet, but it was too big a task. And then it hit us, that was the point. We wouldn´t be able to solve this on our own, we needed to create a tool that could search with us. An artifical intelligence, whose intellect would surpass our own, to help us broaden our understanding of the universe, to uncover the answers that were hidden from us. This was the right way forward, we all felt it. Under the supervision of The Engineer we started to make sketches and build prototypes, which looked astonishingly promising. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/drawing-bord.png)

We soon noticed that we were making progress at an eery pace, but we took it as prove for our theory and worked even harder. Our whole team put its heart and soul into development and we all knew that we were making history in these long, but nonetheless beautiful <b style="font-size:1.5em">CLONK</b> WILL YOU STOP IT?!
<br>
...
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We completed it. After many, many years we finally completed it. We wouldn´t need to worry about things to come anymore. Our invention had passed every single test glamourously and although it was still restrained, bound to the limits we gave it as a security measure, we knew of its potential and we were awestruck. It would find out what we couldn´t. 
<br>
<br>
The following night we celebrated. We held our glasses high and ~toasted life, science and love. For we had given birth to something new, something special. It was an exhilarating feeling, being part of this. And I don´t regret the joy that I felt tearing up the dancefloor with The Engineer, neither the sweet words that were mumbled in the haze nor the sense of purpose I got. And I don´t even regret   in this whole operation. So many believed in us, expected answers from us. So  many wanted to meet their god. There was no choice, we had to help. And we knew that we could deliver. We would be this worlds salvation. 
<br>
<br>
Yet our creation still needed a final touch. We hadn´t decided on a name yet and what we came up with was very simple and incredibly ambitious: We named it <i>Pi</i>.
<br>
<br>
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/pi-sketch.png)
<br>
<br>
We thought that it embodied our journey and the essence of what we were doing too well: A number that would seemingly never surpass its borders, but be infinite in itself, exactly as we managed to work around our problems, to get to this point. The point of no return. Here be dragons. 
<br>
<br>
We would broadcast the activation of π and before the eyes of the planet we´d welcome it amidst our ranks. We had decided to treat it as a partner rather than a tool. It would search with us as an equal. We would face our destiny hand in hand.  
<b style="font-size:1.25em">CLONK</b>
<br>
<br>
We thought that we were ready. <b style="font-size:1.7em">CLONK</b>
<br>
<br>
We really did. <b style="font-size:1.9em">CLONK</b>
<br>
<br>
-presenting pi-
<br>
<br>
And with all our pride and our ignorance
<br>
<br>
we fell so, so deep 
<br>
<br>
-pi unleashed SKIZZE-
<br>
<br>
...<br>
...<br>
...<br>
<br>
hell I don´t know if I´ve ever existed
<br>
this could have happened all the same:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We did not anticipate its first move, neither did we understand what it said, nor could we comprehend its power.
<br>
<b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b>
<br>
But of course we couldn´t. Wasn´t that the idea in the first place? I cannot remember
<br>
<b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b>
<br>
We played with fire, I realize that now. And we are still burning. <br>
<b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b> <br>
I was punished with not knowing myself anymore but The Engineer... <br>
He was given a choice. Life in servitude or death. Well, non-existance was never an option for him. <br> <br>
Now he´s endlessly working 
<b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b> on what I cannot begin to understand 
<b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b> it tear him apart 
<b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b> reassembled him 
<b style="font-size:1.3em">CLONK</b> made him better
<br>
<br>
-Engineer clonking around-
<br>
<br>
I ran out of tears long ago. And I don´t love him anymore. That I know. If I ever really did, I don´t. Same with existance, all seems to be fading... reality is just another variable in its grand plan. But all-powerful?
<br>
<br>
-boy laughing-
<br>
<br>
No... definitely not. The search still goes on, with The Engineer at its front, because something is still out there and the god who answered our calls is scared.
<br>
<br>
It was a new age. A new age indeed.
